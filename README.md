This project is a Single Page Application tool to manage personal or professional routine, like remember to chill out after focusing some time on one single activity, take a break and get a coffee or just stand up to strech a little.
<br><br>
You can set an activity that you want to create a timer between 5 to 60 minutes with 5 minutes steps and it has 3 status:
<br>
- Finalizado (Green): Is when the time that you set initially runs full without interruptions
- Em Andamento (Yellow): When there's an active cycle/activity
- Interrompido (Red): When you click on "Interromper" before the time that you set to that activity runs out by itself.
<br><br>

This project also has an History page that saves all the activities that you worked or are actively working on in the browser's local storage.
It has a table structure with name of the task, set duration, when it started and the status (mentioned before).
